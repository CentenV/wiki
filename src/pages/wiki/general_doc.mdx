# Documentation - wiki.centen.dev

Goal: Provide a platform for logging information and presenting articles/tutorials/guides about any computer science topic

## Wiki Page Hierarchy
Pages are built in hierachy where intermediate pages are the root of every page. 

All tree leaves must be content pages. An intermediate page cannot be at the leaf of the tree and no content page may have page as its child(ren).

<u>Sample page hierarchy:</u>
![](/page_model.svg)

## Page File Hierarchy
New pages are added to the `src/pages` directory
```
src/pages
|
+ topic: Name of the topic
    | 
    + (subtopic)?
    |
    + index.astro
    |
    + page.mdx
```

`index.astro`: Intermediate page boilerplate 

`page.mdx`: Content page. Multiple .mdx content pages can be located under one topic

`(subtopic)?`: Any subtopics. Intermediate pages can be nested in other intermediate pages
